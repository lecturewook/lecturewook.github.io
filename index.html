                            Welcome!   
                        <br />
                        <br>I am interested in researching the political inclusion and representation of marginalized groups, particularly immigrant communities.
                         <br /> 
                            My research investigates the political inclusion and representation of marginalized groups, with a particular emphasis on immigrant communities. 
                            I examine through the lens of three key factors: 
                            (1) anti-immigrant sentiments within immigrant communities, (2) native citizens‚Äô perceptions of immigrants, and (3) the efficacy of immigration policies.
                            These interconnected factors critically shape immigrants‚Äô political participation and their capacity to achieve substantive representation in host societies.
                            Building on this foundation, my recent work explores the cognitive heuristics underlying voter attitudes toward immigration, 
                            the dynamics of political representation, and the electoral behavior of immigrant populations. 
    
                         <br />
                            Methodologically, I employ experimental political science, quantitative analysis, and data science to rigorously dissect causal mechanisms in immigrant political behavior.
                            By employing experiments in political science and quantitative methods,
                            I aim to contribute to academic discussions and accurately piece together the puzzles of political issues related to immigrants.
                            Additionally, I apply data science and public policy as key research tools. 
                            Using machine learning, and large-scale survey data, I identify patterns in political opinions and behavior. 
                            Public policy analysis further helps me evaluate how laws, government programs, and political institutions support or limit immigrant political inclusion. 
                            Through this approach, I seek to proactively identify emerging issues that may arise and need further discussion in the future. 
                            Ultimately, my goal is to evolve into a scholar who bridges empirical rigor with policy relevance, offering holistic insights into both present and future challenges.
                        <br />
                            For this ultimate goal, I have studied political science, demography, and public policy.
                            I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Political Science and a Master‚Äôs degree in Public Policy. 
                            Also, I worked at the Population Policy Laboratory (at KDI School), from 2022 to 2023.
                            These experiences have equipped me with the theoretical and practical tools to address the structural challenges and social attitudes that influence immigrant political behavior.

                        <!---<br>ÏõêÎ≥∏:My research examines immigrant representation, societal perceptions of immigrant communities, and cultural assimilation processes. 
                        I am particularly interested in the internal dynamics within immigrant communities, native citizens‚Äô perceptions of immigrants,
                        examining the political representation and voting behavior of immigrants and other marginalized groups in response to recent changes in population structure. 
                        <!---For example, I aim to study how the increase in immigrant populations, changes in the age distribution of immigrants, declining fertility rates among native citizens,
                        and shifts within other marginalized groups influence their political engagement and representation. --->
                       <!--- To address these issues, I draw on interdisciplinary perspectives from political science, data science, public policy, demography, and psychology. 
                        Additionally, I specialize in experimental political science and mixed-methods approaches, which enable a more comprehensive exploration of my research interests. 
                        I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in political science and Master‚Äôs degree in public policy.
